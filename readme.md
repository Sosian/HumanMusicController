Goal: Get as much Live Streamed Data from the PolarH10 Sensor and map it as MIDI Data to be received by a DAW.

Current approach:
* Copied some code for bluetooth connection from https://github.com/uwburn/cardia to have a starting point. But that will be refactored and changed as time goes on.
* Port all interesting live data from the Polar SDK from https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk to C#
* Use loopMidi (https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) as a Middle Man to send MIDI Data to the DAW
