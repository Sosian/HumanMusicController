Goal: Get as much Live Streamed Data from the PolarH10 Sensor to be used in a different project.

Current approach:
* Copied some code for bluetooth connection from https://github.com/uwburn/cardia to have a starting point. But that will be refactored and changed as time goes on.
* Port everything needed from the Polar SDK from https://github.com/polarofficial/polar-ble-sdk to C#
